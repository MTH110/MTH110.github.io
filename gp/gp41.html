<h1 id="guided-practice-4.1-quadratic-functions-and-parabolas">Guided Practice 4.1: Quadratic Functions and Parabolas</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this section we're going to find that not all data sets follow a linear pattern. Some follow an &quot;up and then down&quot; or &quot;down and then up&quot; pattern, so a line won't fit the data -- but a <em>curve</em> might. We introduce a new kind of function called a <em>quadratic function</em> whose graph is a shape called a <em>parabola</em> that will fit data with this up-and-down or down-and-up patter well.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Define the terms <em>quadratic function</em> and <em>parabola</em>.</li>
<li>Explain the differences between the <em>standard form</em> of a quadratic function and the <em>vertex form</em> of a quadratic function.</li>
<li>Given the formula for a function, determine whether the function is linear, quadratic, or neither.</li>
<li>Given the graph of a quadratic function, determine the following: the coordinates of its vertex; the values for which the function is increasing; the values for which the function is decreasing; the horizontal intercepts; the vertical intercept; and values of the function (for example, <span class="math">\(f(4)\)</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a table of data that have a quadratic pattern, find the horizontal and vertical intercepts of a quadratic function that fits the data.</li>
<li>Given a table of data that have a quadratic pattern, find the vertex of a quadratic function that fits the data and determine whether the vertex is a maximum point or a minimum point.</li>
<li>Use a quadratic function (given as a data table, graph, or formula) that models a real-life application and use the function to answer questions about the application.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In your <em>Intermediate Algebra</em> textbook read Section 4.1. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>: Watch the following video(s) at the GVSU Mathematics Department YouTube channel:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/FP8yUz4nXoU?list=PL476C3C1676343E03">110-20 Graphing Quadratic Functions</a> (Running time 12:19) <!-- + [110-21 Parabolas](https://youtu.be/r4GOpg9ANcU?list=PL476C3C1676343E03) (Running time 13:51) --></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Below are several functions named <span class="math">\(A(x)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(B(x)\)</span>, and so on. For each one, determine whether the function is linear, quadratic, or other. On the response form, select the button in the appropriate column for each function.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{align*}
A(x) &amp;= 2x^2 - x + 1 \\
B(x) &amp;= 2x + 1 \\
