<h1 id="guided-practice-5.5-exponential-growth-and-compounding-interest">Guided Practice 5.5: Exponential Growth and Compounding Interest</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In previous lessons, you've learned about <em>exponential functions</em>. In this lesson, we will apply the concepts of exponential functions to study something we deal with every day, namely <em>exponential growth</em> and especially <em>compounding interest</em>. We all deal with compounding interest each day, whether it's a bank account, car or student loan, or a mortgage on a house. With a knowledge of the mathematics behind how these financial instruments work, you'll be in greater control of your financial decision-making.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a quantity that is growing (or decaying) at an exponential rate, and given the growth (or decay) rate and initial size of the quantity, write a formula for that quantity.</li>
<li>Given an exponential growth (or decay) model, find the growth (or decay) rate.</li>
<li>Given the principal, annual interest rate, and compounding period for a financial account that pays compound interest, find the amount in the account after a certain period of time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Given the principal and annual interest rate for a financial account that pays compound interest compounded continuously, find the amount in the account after a certain period of time.</li>
<li>Given four of the five variables in the compounding interest formula, find or estimate the value of the fifth.</li>
<li>Given three of the four variables in the continuously compounding interest formula, find or estimate the value of the fourth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In your <em>Intermediate Algebra</em> textbook read Section 5.5. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>: Watch the following video(s) at the GVSU Mathematics Department YouTube channel:</p>
<ul>
<li>For those who need a quick introduction or refresher on the concept of interest and compounding interest, from a money perspective and not a math perspective, watch this video: <a href="https://www.commoncraft.com/video/saving-money-compound-interest" class="uri">https://www.commoncraft.com/video/saving-money-compound-interest</a></li>
<li>This video focuses on the math in this lesson: <a href="https://youtu.be/_jp1yJxvOeQ">110-30 Compound interest</a> (6:46)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>One exponential model for the population of the Earth is <span class="math inline">\(P(t) = 4(1.019)^t\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is measured in years since 1975 (that is, <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> is the year 1975, <span class="math inline">\(t=10\)</span> is the year 1985, etc.) and <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is the population of the Earth in billions. Using this model, what is the population of the Earth in 2015?</li>
<li>Using the same model as in question 1, what is the growth rate of the world's population?</li>
<li>In the first video listed above, Jasmine had desposited $100 into a bank account that paid 3% APY (the annual interest rate). Suppose that this interest is compounded monthly. Assuming she does not deposit any more money into the account, how much will she have in the account after one year?</li>
<li>Repeat question 3 if the interest is compounded continuously.</li>
