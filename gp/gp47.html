<h1 id="guided-practice-4.7-graphing-quadratics-from-standard-form">Guided Practice 4.7: Graphing Quadratics from Standard Form</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>We've seen that we can extract a lot of information about a quadratic function if it's given to us in <em>vertex form</em>. At a glance, we can tell information about whether the parabola opens up or down, the location of the vertex, and information about the axis of symmetry. But what if we are working with a quadratic that <em>isn't</em> in vertex form but in <em>standard form</em>, that is in the form <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\)</span>? The information we want to apply from such a function may not be obvious, but in this lesson we will find some ways to quickly determine the information we need.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Given the formula for a quadratic in standard form:
<ul>
<li>Find the vertical intercepts.</li>
<li>Find the horizontal intercepts.</li>
<li>State the coordinates of the vertex.</li>
<li>Determine whether the parabola opens up or down.</li>
<li>Identify the axis of symmetry and write it as an equation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the domain and range of a quadratic.</li>
<li>Given the standard form of a quadratic, sketch the parabola by hand.</li>
<li>Given a quadratic that models a real-life situation, sketch a graph by hand, determine its characteristics (vertex, axis of symmetry, domain, range, etc.) and interpret the meanings of these characteristics in context.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In your <em>Intermediate Algebra</em> textbook read Section 4.7. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>: Watch the following video(s) at the GVSU Mathematics Department YouTube channel:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a refresher, re-watch <a href="https://youtu.be/FP8yUz4nXoU?list=PL476C3C1676343E03">110-20 Graphing Quadratic Functions</a> (Running time 12:19)</li>
<li>Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/r4GOpg9ANcU?list=PL476C3C1676343E03">110-21 Parabolas</a> (running time 13:51)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Find the vertical and horizontal intercepts of the following quadratics: <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 2x^2 + 4x - 3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 100\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(h(a) = -2(a+2)^2 - 10\)</span>.</li>
<li>Find the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>- and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-coordinates of the vertices of each of the three parabolas from the previous question.</li>
<li>For each of the parabolas in question 1, determine whether the parabola opens up or down. There is a grid at the submission form for you to enter your answers.</li>
<li>For this item, play with the applet embedded below, which shows a quadratic in standard form <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\)</span> along with sliders that let you control <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Observe the <em>vertex</em> of the parabola and the <em>axis of symmetry</em> as you move the sliders. On the submission form, answer the two questions given about the vertex and the axis of symmetry.</li>
