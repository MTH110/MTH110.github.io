<h1 id="guided-practice-8.1-radical-functions">Guided Practice 8.1: Radical Functions</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>We've used different kinds of functions lately to model data that have different &quot;shapes&quot;. Linear functions were good models for data that were arranged more or less in a straight line; quadratic functions were good models for data that had parabolic shapes. In this lesson we introduce a new kind function called a <em>radical function</em> that has a shape that is unlike linear or quadratic functions. In this lesson you'll learn about radical functions with different <em>indices</em> and their behavior, focusing on using them as models for data.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate a radical function at a point and estimate numerically where a radical function attains a particular value.</li>
<li>Describe characteristics of a scatterplot that would make it appropriate for a radical function model as opposed to a linear or quadratic function model.</li>
<li>Identify the graphs of radical functions odd and even indices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the domain and range of a radical function.</li>
<li>Graph radical functions.</li>
<li>Use a radical function to model data arising from real world applications.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In your <em>Intermediate Algebra</em> textbook read Section 8.1. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>: Watch the following video(s) at the GVSU Mathematics Department YouTube channel:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/uRr6Nq9WbP0">Radical graphs</a> (7:46)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Consider the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \sqrt[5]{x-14}\)</span>. Evaluate <span class="math inline">\(f(-12)\)</span> to three decimal places.</li>
<li>Again consider the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \sqrt[5]{x-14}\)</span>. Estimate numerically where <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = -9.5\)</span>.</li>
<li>The heights of boys of various ages are given in the table below:</li>
</ol>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center">Age (months)</th>
<th align="center">4.5</th>
<th align="center">10.5</th>
<th align="center">12</th>
<th align="center">24</th>
<th align="center">36</th>
<th align="center">48</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">Average height (feet)</td>
<td align="center">2.05</td>
<td align="center">2.3</td>
<td align="center">2.45</td>
<td align="center">2.75</td>
<td align="center">2.95</td>
<td align="center">3.2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>And the data from the table are on the following scatterplot:</p>
<p><a title="View with the Desmos Graphing Calculator" href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/wu0nfuumzy"> <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/calc_thumbs/production/wu0nfuumzy.png" width="200px" height="200px"     style="border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:5px"  /></a></p>
<p>Why might it make sense in this case to model the data with a radical function, and not a linear or quadratic function? Give a brief explanation that makes your reasoning clear.</p>
<p>.4. Go to the interactive graph found at this link: <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gl54kust2b" class="uri">https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gl54kust2b</a> This allows you to explore the graph of <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \sqrt[n]{x}\)</span> for different whole number values of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Note that we have to use fractional exponents to make the graph; for example <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt[5]{x}\)</span> is the same as <span class="math inline">\(x^{1/5}\)</span>. Briefly describe in a clear way the differences between odd and even indices of the radical function graphs.</p>
