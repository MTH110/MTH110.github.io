<h1 id="guided-practice-4.2-graphing-quadratics-in-vertex-form">Guided Practice 4.2: Graphing Quadratics in Vertex Form</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Now that we have learned about quadratic functions and their usefulness, we will look at a particular form of a quadratic called <em>vertex form</em>. Just like we sometimes write numbers in different forms (for example, the number &quot;13&quot; can also be written in the forms &quot;thirteen&quot; or &quot;XIII&quot;) the vertex form of a quadratic is a way of phrasing a quadratic that makes it easy to get information about the function just by looking at the form. In this section we'll study how to extract information from a quadratic just by looking at its vertex form, and then put that process to use in real-world situations.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Given the formula for a quadratic in vertex form:
<ul>
<li>State the coordinates of the vertex.</li>
<li>Determine whether the parabola opens up or down.</li>
<li>Identify the axis of symmetry and write it as an equation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the domain and range of a quadratic.</li>
<li>Given the formula for a quadratic in vertex form -- that is, in the form <span class="math">\(f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k\)</span> -- explain the effects of the parameters <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(k\)</span> on the graph of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>.</li>
<li>Given the vertex form of a quadratic, sketch the parabola by hand.</li>
<li>Given a quadratic the models a real-life situation, sketch a graph by hand, determine its characteristics (vertex, axis of symmetry, domain, range, etc.) and interpret the meanings of these characteristics in context.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In your <em>Intermediate Algebra</em> textbook read Section 4.1. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>: Watch the following video(s) at the GVSU Mathematics Department YouTube channel:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a refresher, re-watch <a href="https://youtu.be/FP8yUz4nXoU?list=PL476C3C1676343E03">110-20 Graphing Quadratic Functions</a> (Running time 12:19)</li>

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<p>In the exercises, you'll be exploring the <em>vertex form</em> of a quadratic. This refers to the formula for a quadratic when it is put into the form <span class="math">\(f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k\)</span>. For example, <span class="math">\(f(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2\)</span> is not in vertex form; but <span class="math">\(f(x) = 2(x-1)^2 - 4\)</span> <em>is</em> in vertex form, and note that these two functions are the same. (You can see this by multiplying out <span class="math">\(2(x-1)^2 - 4\)</span>.) Specifically, we want to know:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What information can we determine about a quadratic easily, if it is written in vertex form?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To explore this idea, use the interactive applet below. There are interactive controls for <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(h\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k\)</span> using the sliders. As you move the sliders back and forth, the function changes, and you can see its formula and its graph change. Also, the vertex and axis of symmetry are shown, and these also change as you move the sliders.</p>

<p>(In case you cannot see the applet, here is a direct link: <a href="http://ggbtu.be/m1458991">http://ggbtu.be/m1458991</a>)</p>
<p>Move the sliders around and observe how the parameters <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(k\)</span> affect the shape of the graph. Also pay attention to the formula as you move the sliders. Give yourself 5-10 solid minutes of careful observation and write down what you see (in your notes). Then answer the following questions at the response form.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What effect does changing the value of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> have on the graph? Give your answer in 1-2 clear, complete, and correct English sentences.</li>
<li>What effect does changing the value of <span class="math">\(h\)</span> have on the graph? Give your answer in 1-2 clear, complete, and correct English sentences.</li>
<li>What effect does changing the value of <span class="math">\(k\)</span> have on the graph? Give your answer in 1-2 clear, complete, and correct English sentences.</li>
<li>Suppose you are given the quadratic function <span class="math">\(f(x) = -3(x-2)^2 + 5\)</span>. In terms of the parameters you just played with, this is <span class="math">\(a = -3\)</span>, <span class="math">\(h = 2\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(k = 5\)</span>. <em>Without graphing the function</em>, state the following: the coordinates of the vertex, the equation for the axis of symmetry, and whether the graph is opening up or opening down. On the response form, there are three separate items for each of these quantities. &quot;Exercise 4a&quot; refers to the coordinates of the vertex; &quot;Exercise 4b&quot; refers to the equation for the axis of symmetry; and &quot;Exercise 4c&quot; refers whether it is opening up or down.</li>
<li>Give a formula for a quadratic whose graph (which is a parabola) opens upward, has a vertex at the point <span class="math">\((-3, 5)\)</span>, and has an axis of symmetry given by <span class="math">\(x = -8\)</span>.</li>
<li>If we are given a quadratic in vertex form (<span class="math">\(f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k\)</span>), explain how to tell <em>without graphing</em> where the vertex is located, where the axis of symmetry is located, and whether the graph opens upward or downward. Your complete answer should consist of 3-5 clear, complete, and correct English sentences.</li>
