# Applications 8.1: Radical Functions

## Overview

In this exercise, you'll work with a small group to apply what you learned in the Guided Practice to a real-life situation. Remember that when working in your groups, it's important to: 

+ __Ask questions__ -- even if it's over something simple or something you've seen before. 
+ __Contribute thoughts__ -- realize your perspective is valuable, and you can have something positive to contribute even if you are not sure of something. 
+ __Work actively__ -- keep the discussion going and don't let yourself slip into being just a passive listener. 
+ __Stay positive__ -- be welcoming and encouraging of others, use positive language, and have fun. 

## Activation 

Before you begin on the main exercises, answer the following questions in your group. 

1. What is a radical function? 
2. What is the index of a radical function and how does it affect the shape of a radical function's graph? 
3. Why might someone use a radical function to model a set of data as opposed to a linear or quadratic? 

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Mammal Modeling

(This is problem 4 from the Exercises in Section 8.1.)

Dr. Marina Silva, in the _Journal of Mammalogy_ (1998), gives the following formula for the approximate body length of mammals based on the mammal's body mass:

$$L(M) = 0.330 \sqrt[3]{M}$$

where $L(M)$ represents the body length in meters of a mammal with a body mass of $M$ kilograms. 

1. Use this model to estimate the body length of mammal with a body mass of 4.6 kilograms. 
2. Use this model to estimate the body length of a mammal with a body mass of 25 kilograms.
3. If this model i valid for mammals with body masses between 0.01 and 250 kilograms, what is this model's range? 
4. Estimate numerically the body mass of a mammal with a body length of 1 meter. 

### Exercise 2: Dropping things

(This is mostly problem 2 from the Exercises in Section 8.1.)

The physics department is doing an experiment testing the time it takes for an object to fall from different heights. One group collected the following data: 

| Height (ft) | Drop Time (sec) | 
| :---------: | :-------------: |
| 4 | 0.49 | 
| 6 | 0.6 | 
| 11.5 | 0.82 | 
| 18.5 | 1.05 | 
| 23   | 1.17 | 
| 37   | 1.48 | 
| 54.5 | 1.8 | 

1. Let $T(h)$ be the drop time in seconds for an object that is dropped from $h$ feet. Plot these data along with the model $T(h) = 0.243 \sqrt{h}$. How good is the fit .
2. Use the model to determine the drop time for an object dropped from 15 feet. 
3. Use the model to determine the drop time for an object that is dropped from 100 feet. 
4. Determine a reasonable domain and range for this model. 
5. Estimate numerically what height an object must be dropped from, to have a drop time of 2 seconds. 
6. Using the scatterplot, find a linear model for the drop time data and re-answer questions 2--5 above. How far off are the results from the radical function model? 


## Conclusions

On a separate paper, take no more than three minutes and give a substantive response to each of these questions: 

1. In 2-3 sentences, what did you accomplish in your group work today? 
2. What's 1-2 interesting math-related things you learned in your group work today? 
3. What's the muddiest point for you, from the group work today?
