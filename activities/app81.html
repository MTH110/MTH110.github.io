<h1 id="applications-8.1-radical-functions">Applications 8.1: Radical Functions</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you'll work with a small group to apply what you learned in the Guided Practice to a real-life situation. Remember that when working in your groups, it's important to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask questions</strong> -- even if it's over something simple or something you've seen before.</li>
<li><strong>Contribute thoughts</strong> -- realize your perspective is valuable, and you can have something positive to contribute even if you are not sure of something.</li>
<li><strong>Work actively</strong> -- keep the discussion going and don't let yourself slip into being just a passive listener.</li>
<li><strong>Stay positive</strong> -- be welcoming and encouraging of others, use positive language, and have fun.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="activation">Activation</h2>
<p>Before you begin on the main exercises, answer the following questions in your group.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is a radical function?</li>
<li>What is the index of a radical function and how does it affect the shape of a radical function's graph?</li>
<li>Why might someone use a radical function to model a set of data as opposed to a linear or quadratic?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<h3 id="exercise-1-mammal-modeling">Exercise 1: Mammal Modeling</h3>
<p>(This is problem 4 from the Exercises in Section 8.1.)</p>
<p>Dr. Marina Silva, in the <em>Journal of Mammalogy</em> (1998), gives the following formula for the approximate body length of mammals based on the mammal's body mass:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L(M) = 0.330 \sqrt[3]{M}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(L(M)\)</span> represents the body length in meters of a mammal with a body mass of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> kilograms.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use this model to estimate the body length of mammal with a body mass of 4.6 kilograms.</li>
<li>Use this model to estimate the body length of a mammal with a body mass of 25 kilograms.</li>
<li>If this model i valid for mammals with body masses between 0.01 and 250 kilograms, what is this model's range?</li>
<li>Estimate numerically the body mass of a mammal with a body length of 1 meter.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="exercise-2-dropping-things">Exercise 2: Dropping things</h3>
<p>(This is mostly problem 2 from the Exercises in Section 8.1.)</p>
<p>The physics department is doing an experiment testing the time it takes for an object to fall from different heights. One group collected the following data:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center">Height (ft)</th>
<th align="center">Drop Time (sec)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">4</td>
<td align="center">0.49</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">6</td>
<td align="center">0.6</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">11.5</td>
<td align="center">0.82</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">18.5</td>
<td align="center">1.05</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">23</td>
<td align="center">1.17</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">37</td>
<td align="center">1.48</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">54.5</td>
<td align="center">1.8</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Let <span class="math inline">\(T(h)\)</span> be the drop time in seconds for an object that is dropped from <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> feet. Plot these data along with the model <span class="math inline">\(T(h) = 0.243 \sqrt{h}\)</span>. How good is the fit .</li>
<li>Use the model to determine the drop time for an object dropped from 15 feet.</li>
<li>Use the model to determine the drop time for an object that is dropped from 100 feet.</li>
<li>Determine a reasonable domain and range for this model.</li>
<li>Estimate numerically what height an object must be dropped from, to have a drop time of 2 seconds.</li>
<li>Using the scatterplot, find a linear model for the drop time data and re-answer questions 2--5 above. How far off are the results from the radical function model?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>On a separate paper, take no more than three minutes and give a substantive response to each of these questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In 2-3 sentences, what did you accomplish in your group work today?</li>
<li>What's 1-2 interesting math-related things you learned in your group work today?</li>
<li>What's the muddiest point for you, from the group work today?</li>
