<h1 id="applications-4.1-quadratic-functions-and-parabolas">Applications 4.1: Quadratic Functions and Parabolas</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you'll work with a small group to apply what you learned in the Guided Practice to a real-life situation. Remember that when working in your groups, it's important to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask questions</strong> -- even if it's over something simple or something you've seen before.</li>
<li><strong>Contribute thoughts</strong> -- realize your perspective is valuable, and you can have something positive to contribute even if you are not sure of something.</li>
<li><strong>Work actively</strong> -- keep the discussion going and don't let yourself slip into being just a passive listener.</li>
<li><strong>Stay positive</strong> -- be welcoming and encouraging of others, use positive language, and have fun.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="activation">Activation</h2>
<p>Before you begin on the main exercises, answer the following questions in your group.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What exactly is a quadratic function and what makes it different than a linear function?</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is a quadratic function, how do you find the value of <span class="math">\(f(5)\)</span> if <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is given as a formula? As a graph? As a data table?</li>
<li>What is the vertex of a parabola and how do you find it? And how do you tell if it represents a maximum point, or a minimum point?</li>
<li>If <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is a quadratic function and you wanted to find the point or points where <span class="math">\(g(x) = 2\)</span>, how would you do this if <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is given as a graph? As a formula? As a data table?</li>

<h3 id="exercise-1-testing-out-a-golf-ball">Exercise 1: Testing out a golf ball</h3>
<p>This exercise is adapted from Exercise 28 in your textbook.</p>
<p>The US Golf Association (USGA) requires that golf balls be teted to see whether they fall within the official rules of golf. Under one such test, the height of a ball was measured after it was struck by the testing machine. These heights, in feet, are given in the table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Time (seconds)</th>
<th align="left">Height of ball (feet)</th>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(H(t)\)</span> be the height of the golf ball in feet, at <span class="math">\(t\)</span> seconds after being hit by the machine.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Are these data linear? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Make a scatterplot of the data and explain in one sentence why a quadratic function would be a good fit.</li>
<li>On top of your scatterplot, graph the function <span class="math">\(H(t) = -16t^2 + 127t\)</span>. Discuss how well this function fits the data.</li>
<li>Using the formula model, find <span class="math">\(H(6.5)\)</span>. State the units of measurement of the result and explain what the result tells you in the context of the problem.</li>
<li>Estimate the location of the vertex of the parabola.</li>
<li>How high did the ball go, and at what point in time did it start to fall back to earth? Explain in one sentence how you know.</li>
<li>When will the ball hit the ground? Show your work and explain your methods in one sentence.</li>

<h3 id="exercise-2-revenue-from-pizza-sales">Exercise 2: Revenue from pizza sales</h3>
<p>The Algebra Appreciation Club at GVSU decides to sell slices of pizza to raise funds for a trip to the Math Museum. The club leadership needs to decide how much to charge for a slice of pizza. If the price is low, the club will sell a lot of slices but won't make a lot of money. If the price is high, each individual slice will bring in relatively a lot of money, but they won't sell as many slices because they're expensive. Somewhere in between might be a &quot;sweet spot&quot; that will maximize their <em>revenue</em>, a term that refers to how much money the club brings in from their sales (before accounting for expenses incurred in buying the pizza, renting a space, etc.).</p>
<p>The club has planned on ordering 100 slices of pizza to sell. They make the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If they make the price of a pizza slice $0, they will &quot;sell&quot; all 100 slices.</li>
<li>For every dollar they raise the price, they will sell 10 fewer pizza slices. For example, they expect to sell 90 slices if each one is $1, 80 slices if each one is $2, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Make a table of data that shows the number of slices of pizza that will be sold as a function of the price of each slice. Here are the first three rows, based on the data above:</li>
</ol>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Price (dollars)</th>
<th align="left">Number of slices sold</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">0</td>
<td align="left">100</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">1</td>
<td align="left">90</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td align="left">2</td>
<td align="left">80</td>

<p>Is this function linear, or is it quadratic, and how do you know?</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Derive a formula for the number of pizza slices sold as a function of the price of each pizza slice. Show all your work and include a 1-2 sentence summary of what you did.</li>
<li>How much money does the club expect to make if they set the price of a pizza slice at $2? What about $3? Explain your method in one sentence. (This &quot;amount of money made&quot; is what we are calling <em>revenue</em>.)</li>
<li>Based on your method in question 3, make a table that shows the club's revenue as a function of the price of a pizza slice. Is this function linear, or is it quadratic, and how do you know?</li>
<li>Make a scatterplot of the data in the revenue table. Based on a combination of the graph and the data table, how much should the club charge for each pizza slice in order to maximize its revenue from the sale? And how much revenue can they expect to earn?</li>
<li><strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> Derive a <em>formula</em> for the revenue earned by the club as a function of the price of a pizza slice. Using the formula, determine the amount of revenue the club could expect to earn if it charges $2.50 for a pizza slice.</li>
<li><strong>CHALLENGE:</strong> The club, of course, has to buy the pizza in the first place before they can sell it. If the club doesn't make enough revenue, they may end up failing to make a profit -- they will spend more on buying the pizzas than they made by selling them. To get 100 slices of pizza, and assuming a single pizza is cut into 8 slices, they'd need to buy 13 pizzas. (They'd have 4 slices left over.) Suppose each pizza costs $8. What is the minimum amount of money the club should charge for a pizza slice in order to &quot;break even&quot;, so that the revenue earned in the sale equals the costs of buying the pizza? <em>NOTE: There could be more than one way to approach this problem. Do what seems to make sense for your group and then reality-check your result.</em></li>
