<h1 id="applications-5.5-exponential-growth-and-compounding-interest">Applications 5.5: Exponential Growth and Compounding Interest</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you'll work with a small group to apply what you learned in the Guided Practice to a real-life situation. Remember that when working in your groups, it's important to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask questions</strong> -- even if it's over something simple or something you've seen before.</li>
<li><strong>Contribute thoughts</strong> -- realize your perspective is valuable, and you can have something positive to contribute even if you are not sure of something.</li>
<li><strong>Work actively</strong> -- keep the discussion going and don't let yourself slip into being just a passive listener.</li>
<li><strong>Stay positive</strong> -- be welcoming and encouraging of others, use positive language, and have fun.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="activation">Activation</h2>
<p>Before you begin on the main exercises, answer the following questions in your group. Some of these are review.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What exactly is an exponential function, and what makes it different than a linear or quadratic function?</li>
<li>What does the formula for an exponential function look like? What does the graph of an exponential function look like?</li>
<li>How does one figure out the growth or decay rate of an exponential function by looking at the formula for the exponential function?</li>
<li>What is the compounding interest formula, and what do all the variables represent?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<h3 id="exercise-1-modeling-populations">Exercise 1: Modeling populations</h3>
<p>(Based on Exercise 36 in the Review Exercises section for Chapter 5 of <em>Intermediate Algebra</em>.)</p>
<p>The number of Franklin's gulls in North America has been in significant decline in the past several years. The population of Franklin's gulls can be modeled by <span class="math display">\[F(t) =  750(0.9405)^t\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(F(t)\)</span> represents the number of Franklin's gulls in thousands in North America <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> years since 2000.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Just by looking at the model above, and without graphing this function or making a table of data, how can you tell that the population is in decline?</li>
<li>Make a table of data using the model that estimates the population of Franklin's gulls in the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020.</li>
<li>According to the model, what is the rate of decay for the Franklin's gull population?</li>
<li>According to the model, in what year will the population decline to half of its original value in 2000? (There is more than one way to approach this question.)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="exercise-2-how-fast-is-my-country-growing">Exercise 2: How fast is my country growing?</h3>
<p>At this Wikipedia page (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_growth_rate" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_growth_rate</a>) you can find estimated growth rates for various countries throughout the world. Actually there are 4--5 estimates stated for each country, each from a different source. For this exercise, choose a country -- maybe one you'd like to visit someday, or one whose growth rate stands out to you. The only restriction we'll place here is that you should <em>choose a country with a positive growth rate</em> (unlike, for example, Hungary). Then do the following.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write down the growth rate for your country according to the CIA World Fact Book in 2014 (&quot;CIA WF 2014&quot; column on the Wikipedia page).</li>
<li>Look up (online) the population of the country you chose in the year 2014.</li>
<li>You now have enough information to write down a formula for the population of your country in any year. Do so, using examples from your textbook or class discussions as a guide. Please use the following conventions: Let the population be expressed in <em>millions of people</em> rather than just &quot;people&quot;, and let the time be measured in <em>years since 2014</em>. This will keep the numbers smaller and avoid roundoff errors later.</li>
<li>Using your model and a spreadsheet or calculator, make a table of estimated populations for your country for each year, for the years 2014-2020.</li>
<li>About how long will it take for your country to double its population size from its original value in 2014? For example the 2014 population of Australia was 23,943,700; if Australia is your country, then you want to find the time it takes for the population to reach 47,887,400. (There is more than one way to answer that question. Give your answer to at least three decimal places.)</li>
<li>About how long will it take for your country to go from <em>double</em> its 2014 population size to <em>quadruple</em> its 2014 population size? For example if your country was Australia, you want to find the time it takes to go from 47,887,400 to 95,774,800. Once you find this time, compare it to the result from question 5. Notice anything?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="exercise-3-an-interesting-problem">Exercise 3: An interesting problem</h3>
<p>Suppose you have been given $500 as a birthday present from your rich Uncle Mortimer. Rather than spend it on something right away, you decide to be disciplined and invest the money for five years, so that you can withdraw it once you've graduated. After shopping around at different banks, you've found the following investment options. Recall from one of the videos that &quot;APY&quot; (annual percent yield) refers to the annual interest rate.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A savings account that pays 2% APY, compounded twice a year.</li>
<li>A savings account that pays 1% APY, compounded monthly.</li>
<li>A certificiate of deposit (CD) that pays 0.85% APY, compounded twice a month.</li>
<li>A savings account that pays 0.5% APY compounded continuously.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which option will earn you the most money over the 5-year period you intend to let the money sit in the bank? Assume that you are not going to make any additional deposits during that time.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>On a separate paper, take no more than three minutes and give a substantive response to each of these questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In 2-3 sentences, what did you accomplish in your group work today?</li>
<li>What's 1-2 interesting math-related things you learned in your group work today?</li>
<li>What's the muddiest point for you, from the group work today?</li>
