<h1 id="applications-4.2-quadratic-functions-and-parabolas">Applications 4.2: Quadratic Functions and Parabolas</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you'll work with a small group to apply what you learned in the Guided Practice to a real-life situation. Remember that when working in your groups, it's important to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask questions</strong> -- even if it's over something simple or something you've seen before.</li>
<li><strong>Contribute thoughts</strong> -- realize your perspective is valuable, and you can have something positive to contribute even if you are not sure of something.</li>
<li><strong>Work actively</strong> -- keep the discussion going and don't let yourself slip into being just a passive listener.</li>
<li><strong>Stay positive</strong> -- be welcoming and encouraging of others, use positive language, and have fun.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="activation">Activation</h2>
<p>Before you begin on the main exercises, answer the following questions in your group.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What exactly is a quadratic function and what makes it different than a linear function?</li>
<li>What is the vertex form of a quadratic?</li>
<li>If you're given a quadratic in vertex form, how do you (quickly) find the coordinates of the vertex, whether parabola opens up or down, and an equation for the axis of symmetry?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="exercise-1-understanding-information-from-an-income-model">Exercise 1: Understanding information from an income model</h3>
<p>(Taken from Exercise 27 in the textbook.)</p>
<p>If your income level is less than the poverty threshhold, you are considered to be in poverty. The poverty threshhold is not a fixed amount but changes with time, as the economy changes. The poverty threshhold for an individual under 65 years old can be modeled by:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[P(t) = 4.95(t-57)^2 + 1406\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(P(t)\)</span> represents the poverty threshhold (in dollars) for an individual in the United States under 65 years old, where <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is the number of years since 1900. (So for example, <span class="math">\(t = 35\)</span> is the year 1935.)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What was the poverty threshhold in 1990?</li>
<li>Calculate <span class="math">\(P(80)\)</span> and explain its meaning in terms of the poverty threshhold.</li>
<li>Without graphing <span class="math">\(P(t)\)</span>, state the year in which the poverty threshhold was at a minimum. Explain how you know.</li>
<li>In what year was the poverty threshhold equal to the value of the poverty threshhold in the year 1980? Find this value without plugging anything into the formula for <span class="math">\(P(t)\)</span>.</li>
<li>What was the average rate of change in the poverty threshhold (a) from 1960 to 1970, (b) from 1970 to 1980, (c) from 1980 to 1990, (d) from 1990 to 2000, and (e) from 2000 to 2010? Comment on the way in which the poverty threshhold is changing over time and what this would mean to an ordinary US citizen.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="exercise-2-modeling-projectile-motion">Exercise 2: Modeling projectile motion</h3>
<p>Alice and Bob are heaving water balloons from the roof of a building at unsuspecting classmates below. The height of Alice's balloon above the ground (in feet) <span class="math">\(t\)</span> seconds after being released is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[A(t) = -16t^2 + 400\]</span></p>
<p>The height of Bob's balloon above the ground (in feet) <span class="math">\(t\)</span> seconds after being released is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[B(t) = -16(t-1)^2 + 416\]</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are the values of <span class="math">\(A(0)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B(0)\)</span>? What does this mean in everyday terms?</li>
<li>Without graphing either of these two functions, state the time at which each water balloon reaches its highest point, and determine what those highest points are.</li>
<li>You should have discovered that Bob's balloon goes higher than Alice's. At what time does Bob's balloon return to the height from which it was released? Find this time value without doing any algebra.</li>
<li>Which balloon hits the ground first? And what are the times when each balloon hits the ground?</li>
<li>Find the average rates of change in the height of each balloon over the following time intervals: <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span> to <span class="math">\(t=1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(t=1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(t=2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(t=2\)</span> to <span class="math">\(t=3\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(t=3\)</span> to <span class="math">\(t=4\)</span>. Any patterns to notice here?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>On a separate paper, take no more than three minutes and give a substantive response to each of these questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In 2-3 sentences, what did you accomplish in your group work today?</li>
<li>What's 1-2 interesting math-related things you learned in your group work today?</li>
<li>What's the muddiest point for you, from the group work today?</li>
