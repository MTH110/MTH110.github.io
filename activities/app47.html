<h1 id="applications-4.7-graphing-quadratics-in-standard-form">Applications 4.7: Graphing Quadratics in Standard Form</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you'll work with a small group to apply what you learned in the Guided Practice to a real-life situation. Remember that when working in your groups, it's important to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ask questions</strong> -- even if it's over something simple or something you've seen before.</li>
<li><strong>Contribute thoughts</strong> -- realize your perspective is valuable, and you can have something positive to contribute even if you are not sure of something.</li>
<li><strong>Work actively</strong> -- keep the discussion going and don't let yourself slip into being just a passive listener.</li>
<li><strong>Stay positive</strong> -- be welcoming and encouraging of others, use positive language, and have fun.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="activation">Activation</h2>
<p>Before you begin on the main exercises, answer the following questions in your group. Some of these are review.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What exactly is a quadratic function and what makes it different than a linear function?</li>
<li>What does a quadratic look like if it's in &quot;standard form&quot;?</li>
<li>How is &quot;standard form&quot; different from &quot;vertex form&quot; which you studied earlier?</li>
<li>If you're given a quadratic in standard form, how do you (quickly) find the coordinates of the vertex, whether parabola opens up or down, and an equation for the axis of symmetry?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="exercise-1-pumpkin-chunkin">Exercise 1: Pumpkin Chunkin'</h3>
<p>In physics, we learn that there is a basic framework for modeling the motion of a projectile (something that is shot, thrown, or otherwise propelled through the air). It takes into account two pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>initial height</em> of the object above the ground, and</li>
<li>The <em>initial velocity</em> of the object at the moment it was launched.</li>
</ul>
<p>If <span class="math">\(v_0\)</span> is the initial velocity of the object (measured in feet per second) and <span class="math">\(s_0\)</span> is the initial height of the object (measured in feet), then the height of the object above the ground at any time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math">\[s(t) = -16t^2 + v_0 t + s_0\]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math">\(s\)</span> is measured in feet and <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is measured in seconds.</p>
<p>A popular pastime among some people is <em>pumkpin chunkin</em>, which is the practice of firing a pumpkin out of a machine to see how far it will go. If you don't believe this, watch this video:</p>

<p>(Direct link: <a href="https://youtu.be/tQuEF8cZQdI">https://youtu.be/tQuEF8cZQdI</a> if you are using a printout of this activity.)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Suppose a person in a pumpkin chunkin contest uses a giant slingshot that fires the pumpkin with an initial height of 2 feet and an initial velocity of 75 feet per second (which is a little more than 50 mph). Write down the function for the pumpkin's height above the ground at any time.</li>
<li>Using the formula -- and not a graph -- find the vertex of the parabola given by this function, and explain in real-life terms what it tells you.</li>
<li>Using the formula -- and not a graph -- find an equation for the axis of symmetry of the parabola given by this function, and explain in real-life terms what it tells you.</li>
<li>Using the formula -- again not a graph -- state whether the parabola given by this function opens up or down, and then explain why you didn't need a formula to tell you this.</li>
<li>Sketch a graph of this formula and use it to estimate the domain and range of the function. Then explain what the domain and range tell you in real-life terms.</li>
<li>At <span class="math">\(t=1\)</span> second, the pumpkin's height is <span class="math">\(s(1) = -16(1)^2 + 75(1) + 2 = 61\)</span> feet off the ground. At what time will the pumpkin reach this height again? Explain how you know. (Hint: You don't need algebra for this.)</li>

<h3 id="exercise-2-marketing-a-new-bike">Exercise 2: Marketing a new bike</h3>
<p>This is borrowed from: <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/quadratic-equation-real-world.html">https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/quadratic-equation-real-world.html</a>.</p>
<p>A company has designed a new sports bicycle that, of course, it wants to sell so it can make a profit. Based on data for similar bikes, the company expects the sales of the bike to follow the model <span class="math">\[\text{Unit sales} = 70000 - 200p\]</span> Here, <span class="math">\(p\)</span> represents the price of the bike. The company chooses how much to charge for each bike and different choices lead to different financial results. For example, if the company decides to charge $300 for each bike, then it can expect to sell <span class="math">\(70000 - 200(300) = 10000\)</span> bikes.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Make a table of data that shows how many bikes will be sold at prices of $0, $50, $100, and so on up to a price of $350. (Also, why should the company not charge more than $350?)</li>
<li>The <em>revenue</em> earned by the company on the sale of these bikes is just the number of units sold times the price of each unit. It's the amount of money earned by the company before paying its operating costs. For example, if each bike costs $300 then we will sell 10000 of them (see above) and the revenue will be <span class="math">\(10000 \times 300 = \$3000000\)</span>. Make a third column in your data table that shows the revenue the company makes at each price level.</li>
<li>Based on the data table, it appears there is a price we can choose that will give us the maximum possible revenue. What does that price appear to be? Also, how sure can we be that this price really does give us the maximum revenue?</li>
<li>Now, use your data table and the information elsewhere in the problem to make a <em>formula</em> for the revenue <span class="math">\(R\)</span> earned by the company as a function of the price <span class="math">\(p\)</span> of each bike. (Hint: This will be a quadratic.)</li>
<li>Using your formula, determine: the domain and range of the function, the location of the vertex, the axis of symmetry, the x-intercepts, and whether the parabola opens up or down. From this information, state <em>exactly</em> what the price is that will maximize the company's revenue.</li>
<li><strong>(CHALLENGE QUESTION)</strong> It is going to cost $700,000 for manufacturing setup costs and advertising and it will cost $110 to make each bike. Find a formula for the <em>profit</em> that the company will make from the sales of this bike, as a function of the price <span class="math">\(p\)</span> of each bike. (Profit is revenue minus costs.)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="exercise-3-pumpkin-chunkin----challenge-problem">Exercise 3: Pumpkin Chunkin -- Challenge Problem</h3>
<p><em>Note: You will need a device that can play YouTube videos (smartphone, etc.) as well as a stopwatch in order to do this exercise.</em></p>
<p>At the YouTube location of the video shown above, it says that the video shows the winning shot at a pumpkin chunkin festival, and that this shot travelled a total of 166 feet (horizontally). Using the video and this information, try to reconstruct the formula for the height <span class="math">\(s(t)\)</span> of the pumpkin above the ground at any time. You may want to do some of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time how long it takes for the pumpkin to hit the ground after it was launched.</li>
<li>Estimate any distances you might find helpful, using the video. We are told that the pumpkin traveled 166 feet but there are other heights and distances that might be useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Different groups may get different answers for this depending on how certain quantities are estimated. Focus on the <em>process</em> and be able to explain your reasoning.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>On a separate paper, take no more than three minutes and give a substantive response to each of these questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In 2-3 sentences, what did you accomplish in your group work today?</li>
<li>What's 1-2 interesting math-related things you learned in your group work today?</li>
<li>What's the muddiest point for you, from the group work today?</li>
